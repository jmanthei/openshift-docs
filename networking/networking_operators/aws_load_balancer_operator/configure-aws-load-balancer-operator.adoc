After installing the AWS Load Balancer Operator, you can create the AWS Load Balancer Controller.

include::modules/creating-instance-aws-load-balancer-controller.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


You can route the traffic to different services that are part of a single domain through a single AWS Load Balancer. Each Ingress resource provides different endpoints of the domain.

You can configure the cluster-wide proxy in the AWS Load Balancer Operator. After configuring the cluster-wide proxy, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically updates all the deployments of the Operators with the environment variables such as `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`. These variables are populated to the managed controller by the AWS Load Balancer Operator.
